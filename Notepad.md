#### Ideas / Plans
 * \*bold\* & other markups similar to markdown
 * Refactor index.js into a class
 * Possibly change options()/library to be functional
 * Better/Complete typescript definitions
 * Refactor ANSI into its own class holding deviations from base markup algorithm
 * #FFF & #FFFFFF colorspec
 * Is separate unroll step necessary or does a string get resolved in the right order
    to unroll as we go?

#### Bugs
 * Implement test for being able to escape \\{ and fix.
